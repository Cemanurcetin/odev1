            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Orhan Pamuk was born in 1952 in Istanbul, Türkiye. He studied architecture for a short time
                but later chose to become a full-time writer. His novels often focus on Istanbul, East–West
                relations, and the inner lives of his characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pamuk gained international recognition with novels such as <em>The White Castle</em>,
                <em>The Black Book</em>, and <em>My Name is Red</em>. His works explore themes of memory,
                identity, tradition, and modernity, combining detailed descriptions with philosophical questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2006, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, becoming the first Turkish writer to receive
                this honor. Today, Orhan Pamuk is considered one of the most important voices in world literature,
                and his books have been translated into many languages.
